Hi, 👀 Everyone!

It's been a great experience for me to have remained part of development teams in high-impact projects, with noteworthy ones:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Avionics & Weapons Integration on JF-17 aircraft

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Full Flight & Maintenance Simulation for JF-17

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Hardware design & development with military & aviation standards


For 25+ years I've been associated with learning, applying and teaching programming using various devices, development stacks and platforms.
This includes working with *FPGAs* and *microcontrollers* for a considerable time. Other than the hardware side, my core expertise lies with:


&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; C, C++, Java, C# and Assembly language in mainstream development.

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Scripting with BASH, AWK, PowerShell, and Python.

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Frontend / UI development utilizing XAML, Qt, XML and Web technologies.


However, working with low-level *Windows APIs*, *Linux kernel & distributions*, *RTOSs* (especially *Eclipse ThreadX*), freestanding environments, minimizing security flaws, and maximizing performance are amongst my personal favorites.


💞️ Some of my openly available projects, available for everyone:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***DxSurface***](https://github.com/cronblocks-games/DxSurface) - Under-development, light-weight game engine that utilizes *Windows APIs* and *DirectX* with *modern C++*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***DDS.Net***](https://github.com/dds-dotnet) - Library to host servers with *.NET applications* so as to connect *.NET* and *C++* applications together

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***UTM***](https://github.com/uwshammout/utm) - A *hardware interfacing* and *frontend* application for making *Universal Testing Machines*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***FCM***](https://github.com/uwshammout/fcm) - An application to test and monitor *Fuel Cells* and *Electrolyzers*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***CodeLines***](https://github.com/cronblocks/code-lines) - Counts the total number of lines of code within a given codebase

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; &nbsp; [***ESerial - Qt***](https://github.com/cronblocks/eserial-qt) - Cross-platform application for greatly helping in repetitive communication tasks over a Serial Port

&nbsp; &nbsp; ( ***HELP*** by giving *stars* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, contributing to *code* & *documentation* )



&nbsp;

💞️ Collaborations are *great* that I seek in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Software*/*Firmware* development targeting Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes, ...

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Edge*, *Desktop*, *Mobile* and *Cloud*-apps 🌩️🌩️🌩️

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ecosystem *integrity* and *security*



&nbsp;
