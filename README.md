Hello, there 👋 !

Nice to see you! &nbsp; I'm Usama, an engineer and life-long learner with prior experience of working in the prestigious *military defense*-enabling :basecampy: *aviation industry* ✈️ for many years, serving in various roles and positions; though, keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Reading* 📚, *writing* 🖋️, and *teaching* 🎓 - everything that has anything to do with *modern technologies*

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing: *Realtime* ⏳, *native* 🐡, *cross-platform* ⚔️, *full-stack* 🧮, *bare-metal* 🤘, *networked* and *distributed* 🪐 applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing: *Control systems* 🏗️, *simulations* 〽️ and *games* 🎮 from scratch

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding *AI* and *ML* in-essence - not for using catchy AI jargons to grab attraction ♨️


&nbsp;

💞️ Collaborations are always sought and welcomed, in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Software* 💻 and *firmware* 🚀 development - Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes, ...

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Edge* 🎼, *desktop* 🖥️, *mobile* 📱 and *cloud*-hosted 🌩️ solutions

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ecosystem *integrity* and *security* ㊙️ - an ongoing effort


&nbsp;
