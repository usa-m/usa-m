Hello, there 👋 !

Nice to see you! &nbsp; I'm Usama, an engineer and life-long learner with prior experience of working in the prestigious *military defense*-enabling :basecampy: *aviation industry* ✈️ for many years, serving in various roles and positions; though, keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Reading* 📚, &nbsp; *writing* 🖋️, &nbsp; and *teaching* 🎓 - everything that has anything to do with *modern technologies*

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing: *Realtime* ⏳, &nbsp; *native* 🐡, &nbsp; *cross-platform* ⚔️, &nbsp; *full-stack* 🧮, &nbsp; *bare-metal* 🤘, &nbsp; and *networked / distributed* 🪐 applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing: *Control systems* 🏗️, &nbsp; *simulations* 〽️, &nbsp; and *games* 🎮 &nbsp; from scratch

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding *AI* and *ML* in-essence - not for using catchy AI jargons to grab attraction ♨️


&nbsp;

💞️ Collaborations are always sought and welcomed, in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Software* 💻 &nbsp; and *firmware* 🚀 &nbsp; development - Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes, ...

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Edge* 🎼, &nbsp; *desktop* 🖥️, &nbsp; *mobile* 📱 &nbsp; and *cloud*-hosted 🌩️ &nbsp; solutions

&nbsp; &nbsp; 👀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ecosystem *integrity* and *security* ㊙️ - an ongoing effort


&nbsp;
