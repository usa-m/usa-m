Hi ... I’m @**_usama_** - a self-motivated learner

Possessing background in engineering and curious mind, I've particular interests 👀 in:
  - Understanding our World and Nature
  - Electronics & electrical designs
  - Real-world simulations and games development - employing AR & VR
  - IoT, IIoT and Edge Computing
  - AI with and without ML
  - Native and cross-platform development - Windows; GNU/Linux & its flavors
  - Full-stack development

... In short, __Nature__ and every __piece of technology__ deserve attention.


I've been learning and working to combine all my interests into singularity 🌱

Collaborations are always welcomed ...💞️...
  - Starting from Arduinos, STM32s, BeagleBones and RaspberryPIs etc., etc., etc. ...
  - Connecting edge hardware with backbones - fueled by AI & Big Data - preferably on Cloud
  - Securing the ecosystem ✨ ... of course
