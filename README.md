Nice to see you 👀 here!

Hi 👋 ! I'm Usama, a simple engineer and a life-long learner with former years of working experience in a prestigious *National defense*-enabling *Aviation industry* ✈️ , therein serving in various roles and key positions; though, I'm keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; *Reading* 📚, &nbsp; *writing* 🖋️, &nbsp; and *teaching* 🎓 - anything that relates with *modern and evolving technologies*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing: *Realtime*, &nbsp; *native*, &nbsp; *cross-platform*, &nbsp; *full-stack*, &nbsp; *bare-metal*, &nbsp; and *networked / distributed* 🪐 applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing *control systems*, &nbsp; *simulations*, &nbsp; and *games* &nbsp; from scratch

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding and applying *AI* and *ML* - not for using catchy jargons to grab attraction


&nbsp;

💞️ Recently, I've been contributing to and working on various projects, some are openly available at:
