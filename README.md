Hello, there 👋 !

Nice to see you 👀! &nbsp; I'm Usama, an engineer and life-long learner with years of former working experience in a prestigious *National defense*-enabling *Aviation industry* ✈️ , thereby, serving in various roles and key positions; though, I'm keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; *Reading* 📚, &nbsp; *writing* 🖋️, &nbsp; and *teaching* 🎓 - anything that relates with *modern and evolving technologies*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing: *Realtime*, &nbsp; *native*, &nbsp; *cross-platform*, &nbsp; *full-stack*, &nbsp; *bare-metal*, &nbsp; and *networked / distributed* 🪐 applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing *control systems*, &nbsp; *simulations*, &nbsp; and *games* &nbsp; from scratch

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding and applying *AI* and *ML* - not for using catchy jargons to grab attraction


💞️ Collaborations are always sought and welcomed:

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Software* &nbsp; and *firmware* &nbsp; development - Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes, ...

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; *Edge*, &nbsp; *desktop*, &nbsp; *mobile* &nbsp; and *cloud*-hosted 🌩️ &nbsp; solutions

&nbsp; &nbsp; 🚀 &nbsp; &nbsp; Ecosystem *integrity* and *security* ㊙️ - as an ongoing effort


💞️ Recently, I've been contributing to and working on various projects, some are openly available at:
