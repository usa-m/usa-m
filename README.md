Hello, there 👋 ! Usama here,

I'm an *Avionics Engineer* having working experience in the Aviation industry for quite many years, specifically with interests in:

  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading technology in-depth, developing practical understanding and writing for easy comprehension by others
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Creating native, real-time, cross-platform, full-stack and bare-metal applications
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and developing control systems
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Creating simulations and games in AR/VR spectrum
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Developing distributed applications
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding AI and ML - not just using AI/ML terminology to grab attraction
