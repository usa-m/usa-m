Hello, there 👋 !

Usama here, an engineer and life-long learner having experience of working in the defense-related :basecamp: aviation ✈️ industry for many years ⏲️, but I remain keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Reading 📚, writing 🖋️, and teaching 👨‍🏫 in-depth about technology

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Exploring and enabling native, real-time, cross-platform, full-stack, bare-metal, networked and distributed applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Designing and implementing real-life control systems, simulations and games

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Understanding AI and ML in-depth - not just using AI terminology to grab attention


&nbsp;

💞️ Collaborations are always sought positively, in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Software 🖥️ and firmware 🚀 development - Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes, ...

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Edge ⚗️ and cloud 🌩️ hosted solutions

&nbsp; &nbsp; ♨️ &nbsp; Ecosystem integrity ⁉️ and security ㊙️ - an ongoing process


&nbsp;

🌱 Recently, I've been contributing and working on various projects, some are openly available at:
