Hello, there 👋 ! Usama here, an engineer having working experience in the Aviation industry for quite many years, specifically interested in:

  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Reading, writing and teaching about technology in-depth
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Exploring and enabling native, real-time, cross-platform, full-stack and bare-metal applications
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing real-life control systems, simulations and games
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Developing networked and distributed applications
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding AI and ML - not just using AI/ML terminology to grab attraction


&nbsp;

# 

💞️ Collaborations are always sought :star::star::star: positively, in:
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Software and firmware development - Linux, Windows, Arduino, STM32, BeagleBone, NUCs, \*\*PIs, RTOSes ...
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Edge and cloud solutions
  - &nbsp; &nbsp; Ecosystem integrity and security ✨✨✨ - as much as viable
