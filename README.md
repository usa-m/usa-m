Nice to see you 👀 here!

Hi 👋 ! I'm Usama, an engineer and a life-long learner having former working experience of many years in a prestigious *National defense*-enabling *Aviation industry* ✈️ , therein serving at various key positions in different roles; though, I'm more keenly interested in:

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; *Reading* 📚, &nbsp; *writing* 🖋️, &nbsp; and *teaching* 🎓 - anything that relates with *modern and evolving technologies*

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Realizing: &nbsp; *Realtime*, &nbsp; *native*, &nbsp; *cross-platform*, &nbsp; *full-stack*, &nbsp; *bare-metal*, &nbsp; and *networked / distributed* 🪐 applications

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Designing and implementing *control systems*, &nbsp; *simulations*, &nbsp; and *games* &nbsp; from scratch

&nbsp; &nbsp; ⚔️ &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding and applying *AI* and *ML* - not for catchy jargons to grab attraction


&nbsp;

💞️ Recently, I've been contributing to and working on various projects, some are openly available at:
